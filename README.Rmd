Tutorials for the surveillance package
======

This is the [tutorial project site](https://surveillancer.github.io/tutorials/) of the hackathon

[ESCAIDE 2016](http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/escaide/Pages/ESCAIDE.aspx) conference in Stockholm, Sweden. The hackathon was implicitly
supported by the Swedish Research Council as part of the project
*Statistical Modelling, Monitoring and Predictive Analytics against
Infectious Disease Outbreaks* (grant number 2015-05182_VR).
