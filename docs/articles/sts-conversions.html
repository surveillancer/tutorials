<p>The <strong>surveillance</strong> package holds plenty of data sets from the public health surveillance of infectious disease occurrence. These count time series are objects of the class <code>"sts"</code> (surveillance time series), as illustrated in, e.g., the <a href="ECDC2sts.html">ECDC tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>This enables post-processing of <code>sts</code> objects using other tools. For instance, to generate a plot of the data using <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2"><strong>ggplot2</strong></a>.</p>
<p>First we convert the data into a long format using <code>tidyr</code> and <code>dplyr</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(dplyr)
plot_data &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>hadata %&gt;%<span class="st"> </span>
<span class="st">  </span>tidyr::<span class="kw">gather</span>(counties, count, <span class="kw">starts_with</span>(<span class="st">"observed"</span>)) %&gt;%<span class="st"> </span>
<span class="st">  </span>tidyr::<span class="kw">separate</span>(counties, <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">"key"</span>, <span class="st">"county"</span>), <span class="dt">fill =</span> <span class="st">"left"</span>) %&gt;%<span class="st"> </span>
<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">select</span>(epoch, county, count)
<span class="kw">head</span>(plot_data)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##        epoch county count
## 1 2001-01-01   chwi     0
## 2 2001-01-08   chwi     0
## 3 2001-01-15   chwi     0
## 4 2001-01-22   chwi     0
## 5 2001-01-29   chwi     0
## 6 2001-02-05   chwi     0</code></pre>
<p>Then it is straight forward to plot data in <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(ggplot2)

<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">facet_wrap</span>(~<span class="st"> </span>county) +
<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">xlab</span>(<span class="st">"ISO week"</span>) +

<div id="xts" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor"><html><body><a href="#xts" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>xts</h2>
<p>The <code>as.xts</code> function can be used to transform <code>sts</code> data to the standard <code>"xts"</code> class for time series (there is also an <code>as.ts</code>-method):</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(<span class="st">"xts"</span>)
haxts &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">as.xts</span>(ha.sts)
<span class="kw">plot</span>(haxts)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Warning in plot.xts(haxts): only the univariate series will be plotted</code></pre>
<p><img src="sts-conversions_files/figure-html/as.xts-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Up to old <strong>xts</strong> 0.9-7, this will only plot the first time series Newer versions of <strong>xts</strong> are available from the <a href="https://github.com/joshuaulrich/xts"><strong>xts</strong> GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>This also enables the use of the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dygraphs"><strong>dygraphs</strong></a> package for interactive visualization:</p>
